# Cabbage
Cabbage is a powerful software platform designed for prototyping and developing audio instruments using the Csound audio synthesis language. It allows sound designers and developers to create custom instruments and audio effects through an intuitive and flexible workflow. By leveraging a Visual Studio Code extension, users can easily design and refine their audio projects within a modern coding environment.

One of the key features of Cabbage is its drag-and-drop UI editor, which, alongside a comprehensive library of commonly used widgets, enables rapid development of both simple and complex instruments. This editor provides a visual approach to interface design, making it easier to arrange controls such as sliders, buttons, and other interactive elements without the need to write extensive code from scratch.

Cabbage's user interface is built using webview components, giving users the flexibility to develop custom UIs using popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular. While Cabbage’s built-in widgets are implemented with standard vanilla JavaScript and HTML, these can be easily extended or customized to meet specific project needs, offering great versatility for more advanced developers.

Once an instrument is developed, Cabbage allows you to export it in various plugin formats (such as VST, AU, or AAX), making it compatible with industry-standard Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) like Reaper, Ableton Live, Bitwig, and FL Studio. This provides a seamless workflow for developers who want to bring their creations into professional music production environments.

# Using These Docs
The following documentation will guide you through the fundamental aspects of using Cabbage, from navigating the main features of the development environment to exporting your audio instruments as VST plugins. You’ll also find a comprehensive reference section that covers all of the available GUI widgets. This reference can be accessed from the menu on the right, and it provides detailed information on each widget's properties and use cases.

For quick access, the reference manual is also integrated into the Cabbage code editor, allowing you to consult it without leaving your development workflow. Whether you're just starting with Cabbage or looking to expand your knowledge, these docs will serve as a valuable resource for every stage of your audio instrument development process.

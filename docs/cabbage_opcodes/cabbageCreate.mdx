# CabbageCreate

This opcode will create a new widget based on a JSON object. Note that widgets generated in this way cannot be registered as parameters. This means they cannot be automated by the host.  

## Syntax

**cabbageCreate** *SJson*

### Initialization
* *SJson* – a well-formed JSON string. This will typically look like a JSON object from the Cabbage section JSON array.
 
> Note you need to provide a channel and a valid type when creating the string.  


## Example:

<CodeBlock language="csharp">{widgetCode}</CodeBlock>

## Command Palette Access
Ctrl+S and Ctrl+E are the default shortcuts for running and entering edit mode. The following commands, which don't have keyboard shortcuts attached, are all accessible from the command palette. To access the command palette in Visual Studio Code, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`
- **macOS**: Press `Cmd + Shift + P`

Once the command palette is open, you can start typing the name of the command you want to execute. For example, you can type "Cabbage" to filter the commands related to the Cabbage extension. Select the desired command from the list to execute it. Below are the commands currently provided. 

> It's very simple to assign custom shortcuts to any command palette entry. Simple summon the command, then press the small cogwheel icon that appears on the right of the command. This will bring up a config screen where you can quickly set your preferred shortcuts.

> Exporting creates a new plugin binary and saves it to the specified location. Unlike in Cabbage 2, the .csd file is no longer placed inside the plugin bundle. Instead, it is added to a separate directory along with all the necessary JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files required to support your web-based UI. When the plugin is loaded in a DAW it will serve the contents of the folder using its in-built live server. Each plugin will run on a unique port.

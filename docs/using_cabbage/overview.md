The Cabbage 3 VS Code Extension offers a seamless workflow for designing and testing instruments directly within Visual Studio Code. 

With Cabbage 3, you can:
- Create professional audio plugins using Csound
- Design custom user interfaces using simple JSON objects
- Test your instruments in real-time without leaving VS Code
- Export your creations as VST3 plugins

> As noted above, the current VS Code extension only supports exporting of VST3 effects and synths. AU export targets are currently under development.

```json
"identChannel": "channel"
```
Although identifier channels still work, they are no longer supported. Please use the new [guiMode("queue")](./controlling_widgets.md) system and the `cabbageGet` and `cabbageSet` [opcodes](./cabbage_opcodes.md) instead. They are far more efficient then identifiers channel.

```json
"dobounceInteral": 50
```

Sets the minimum time (in milliseconds) to wait before sending a new parameter update. This helps prevent redundant updates by ensuring only one update is sent per interval, even if multiple changes occur quickly. The default is 50ms.

> This setting does not affect the rate of plugin parameter updates from a DAW, or through user interaction. It only slows down the frequency of data sent to the UI.

```json
"populate":{"filetype":"type", "dir":"defaultDir"}
```

Sets the type of file to search for, and the initial directory to look in. You can specify multiple file types by using the following pattern `*.txt;*.csv;*.dat`. If no directory is specified, the file browser will try to access the current working directory. Note it's always best to set the `directory` property from your Csound code in order to make sure the path is correct. For example, the following code will set the directory to that of the current .csd file. 

```
cabbageSet "presetCombo", "populate.directory", chnget:S("CSD_PATH")
```

```json
"populate":{"filetype":"type", "dir":"defaultDir", "ignoreVal":0}
```

Sets the type of file to search for, and the initial directory to look in. If you wish to list all wave files from a set directory, use "*.wav" as the filetype string. If using the `filebutton` to record parameter snapshots, you must specify a filetype of "\*.snaps", and a mode type of snapshot. If no directory is specified, the file browser will open in the current working directory. If the `ignoreVal` is set to 1 it will ignore the last known location and continue to open from the given directory. If set to 0, or left out completely, the `filebutton` will always open at the last directory the user browsed to. When used with a `combobox`, or `listbox`, it will load all files it finds as selectable items. When clicked, they will send the full file path to Csound.  

If you want to query the widget's current file type or directory you can use `fileType` or `currentDir` with `cabbageGet`.

> You can also set the name of the custom preset file. Instead of passing "\*.snaps" as the file type, pass the full file name, i.e, "myPresets.snaps". Don't pass a full path here. Cabbage will automatically save and locate from the most suitable directory. Note that the same preset filename should be passed to all `filebutton` and `combobox` widgets involved in the management of the presets.

```json
"populate":{"filetype":"type", "dir":"defaultDir"}
```

Sets the type of file to search for, and the initial directory to look in. If you wish to list all wave files from a set directory, use "*.wav" as the filetype string. 

If no directory is specified, the file browser will try to access the current working directory.

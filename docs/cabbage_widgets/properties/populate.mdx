            "populate": {
                "directories": [""],
                "fileType": "",
                "fullFileAndPath": false,
                "order": "date",
                "labelWhenEmpty": "No Files",
                "defaultLabel": ""
            }
```

Sets the type of file to search for, and the directories to look in. You can specify multiple file types by using the following pattern `*.txt;*.csv;*.dat`. If no directories are specified, the file browser will try to access the current working directory. Note it's always best to set the `directories` property from your Csound code in order to make sure the path is correct. For example, the following code will set the directory to that of the current .csd file. 

```
cabbageSet "presetCombo", "populate.directory", chnget:S("CSD_PATH")
```

The items can be ordered by "date", "size" or "alpabetically". "defaultLabel" sets the initial text when the combobox first appears. If it's empty, the first item on the list will appear by default.

```json
"fontColour": "colour"
"fontColour":{ "on":"colour", "off":"colour" } // button and checkbox
```

This property sets the main color, which can be any valid CSS or HTML color string. It also accepts hexadecimal, RGB or RGBA values, where each channel ranges from 0 to 255. For example, `"colour":[0, 0, 255]` creates blue, while `"colour":"#ff0000"` generates a red colour.

Some widgets, such as buttons, have two states, on and off. For these widgets you can pass a JSON object with two keys, "on" and "off", each with a value of a CSS or HTML colour string.

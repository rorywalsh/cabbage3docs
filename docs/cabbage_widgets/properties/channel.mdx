"channels": [
                {
                    "id":"channelName", 
                    "eventType": "valueChanged",
                    "range": {"min":0, "max":100, "value":0, "skew":1, "incr":0.1}

In Cabbage 3, widgets use an array of channels instead of a single channel string. Each channel object includes an id that defines a unique channel name. Widgets in Cabbage 3 can have any number of channels attached to them. An optional eventType property specifies the type of interaction. A range object can define the minimum, maximum, and default values, along with the skew and step increment.

If range is omitted, it defaults to a range from 0 to 1, with increments of 0.001 for widgets that use drag events (e.g., sliders, XY pads) and 1 for widgets that use click or toggle events (e.g., buttons, checkboxes). 

> A widgetâ€™s top-level id property defines the general communication channel for updating attributes, while the channels specified in the channels array are used for value and parameter updates.

Supported event types:

| Event             | Description |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `valueChanged (default)` | Tracks simple value changes |
| `mousePressLeft` | Tracks presses of left mouse button |
| `mousePressRight` | Tracks presses of right mouse button |
| `mousePressMiddle` | Tracks presses of middle mouse button |
| `mouseMoveX` | Tracks movement along X axis. |
| `mouseMoveY` | Tracks movement along Y axis. |
| `mouseDragX` | Tracks movement along X axis with mouse pressed |
| `mouseDragY` | Tracks movement along Y axis with mouse pressed |
| `mouseInside` | Returns max when any mouse button is within the bounds of the widget, min if outside. |

> In Cabbage 3, channels don't need to start with a letter, and white spaces are permitted.

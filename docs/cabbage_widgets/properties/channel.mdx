```json
"channels": [
                {
                    "id":"channelName", 
                    "eventType": "valueChanged",
                    "range": {"min":0, "max":100, "value":0, "skew":1, "incr":0.1}
                }
            ]
```

In Cabbage 3, widgets use an array of channels instead of a single channel string. Each channel object includes an id that defines a unique channel name. Widgets in Cabbage 3 can have any number of channels attached to them. An optional eventType property specifies the type of interaction. A range object can define the minimum, maximum, and default values, along with the skew and step increment.

If range is omitted, it defaults to a range from 0 to 1, with increments of 0.001 for widgets that use drag events (e.g., sliders, XY pads) and 1 for widgets that use click or toggle events (e.g., buttons, checkboxes). 

> A widget’s top-level id property defines the general communication channel for updating attributes, while the channels specified in the channels array are used for value and parameter updates. If no top level id is specified, the first channel.id will be used as the general communication channel.

Supported event types:

| Event             | Description |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `valueChanged (default)` | Tracks simple value changes |
| `mousePressLeft` | Tracks presses of left mouse button |
| `mousePressRight` | Tracks presses of right mouse button |
| `mousePressMiddle` | Tracks presses of middle mouse button |
| `mouseMoveX` | Tracks movement along X axis. |
| `mouseMoveY` | Tracks movement along Y axis. |
| `mouseDragX` | Tracks movement along X axis with mouse pressed |
| `mouseDragY` | Tracks movement along Y axis with mouse pressed |
| `mouseInside` | Returns max when any mouse button is within the bounds of the widget, min if outside. |

> In Cabbage 3, channels don't need to start with a letter and white spaces are permitted.

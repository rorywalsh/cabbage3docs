```json
"imgFile": {"type", "file"}
```
Use this identifier to set a unique .svg or .png file to be used instead of the default look and feel. "type" should be one of the following:
Buttons:
- "on" : sets the button image when it is on
- "off" : sets the button image when it is off
Sliders:
- "background" : sets the slider background image
- "slider" : sets the slider thumb, or in the case of a rotary slider, the inner circle. This image moves in sympathy with that the mouse as users move the slider.

```json
"keypressBaseOctave": 3
```
This sets the base note that is played when you press a key on the computer keyboard. The value must be between 0 and 10. The default is 3 that means the C note of the third MIDI octave (C1 key on the widget keyboard, if you don't change the default 'middleC' value).

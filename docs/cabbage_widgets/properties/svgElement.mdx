```json
"svgElement": "SVG string"
```
The identifier can be used to draw an SVG element to an image. Because SVG Elements contain a lot of Cabbage syntax wildcards and patterns, this identifier must only ever be called from the Csound orchestra. Please make sure you pass valid SVG elements, or elements as a single string.

```json
"ballSize": 20
```
Sets the size (diameter) of the ball in the xyPad widget. The ball represents the current position on the X-Y plane. The default value is 20 pixels. The ball size affects the usable range of the pad - the ball's center is constrained to stay within the pad boundaries, which means larger balls will have their movement range reduced by half the ball size on each edge.

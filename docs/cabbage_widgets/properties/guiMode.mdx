```json
"guiMode": "val"
```
Sets how widgets will be updated. `guiMode("polling")` (default if `guiMode()` is not specified), will cause each widget's channel to be polled for updates at k-boundaries. The update rate is set using the `guiRefresh()` identifier. If you are using a large number of widgets this can get quite slow, especially if the widgets also contains identifier channels defined with `identChannel()`.
Using guiMode("queue") will improve performance, especially if you are using a large number of widgets. `identChannel()` identifiers are not supported when `guiMode` is set to "queue". In this case you can use the cabbageSet/Set opcodes to set and get data from a widget. More details can be found here.

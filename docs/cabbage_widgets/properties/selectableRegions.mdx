When enabled, users can click and drag on the waveform to select a region of samples. The selected region is highlighted with a semi-transparent overlay.

**Behavior:**
- **Click and drag**: Select a region by clicking on the waveform and dragging to define the selection boundaries
- **Click without drag**: Clicking without dragging (less than 3 pixels of movement) clears the current selection
- **Visual feedback**: Selected regions are shown with a semi-transparent overlay
- **Channel output**: When a region is selected, the start and end sample indices are automatically sent to Csound via the configured channels (see `channelGentable`)

This feature is useful for selecting portions of audio for processing, looping, or analysis.

```json
"package" : {
    "include": [ {"src": "sample", "dest": "samples"} ]
},
```

The package object is used to manage the resources required by your instruments when they are exported. The package accepts an array of `src/dest` pairs. The `src` value may be a relative or absolute path and can include file wildcards (for example, * or **).

```json 
"include": [ {"src": "/Users/me/cabbage3-recipes/samples/*.wav", "dest": "audioSamples"} ]
```

This example copies all `.wav` files from the samples folder into an audioSamples folder located at the top level of the exported plugin’s resources directory.

```json
"channel": {"id": "genTable1", "start": "region_start", "length": "region_length"}
```
Defines the channel configuration for the genTable widget:
- **id**: Unique identifier for the genTable widget itself. Use this channel with `cabbageSet` to update any of the genTable's attributes.
- **start**: Channel name for the selection start position (sample index). This channel is updated when the user selects a region on the waveform (only when `selectableRegions` is enabled)
- **length**: Channel name for the selection length (number of samples). This channel is updated when the user selects a region on the waveform (only when `selectableRegions` is enabled)

The start and length channels are only used when `selectableRegions` is enabled. You can read these values in your Csound code using `cabbageGetValue` to process or analyze the selected region. The end position can be calculated as `start + length`.

**Example usage in Csound:**
```csound
kRegionStart cabbageGetValue "region_start"
kRegionLength cabbageGetValue "region_length"
kRegionEnd = kRegionStart + kRegionLength
; Process the selected region...
```

```json
"tableNumber": 1
```
Sets the table/tables to be displayed. If multiple tables are specified the tables will be superimposed on top of each other. If multiple tables are specified with a colon between then the tables will be stacked on top of each other along the Y-axis, e.g., tableNumber(1:2:3:4). Note changing table numbers at runtime will incur a slight performance here. It's simpler to copy the contents of a source table to the table `gentable` or `soundfiler` are displaying.

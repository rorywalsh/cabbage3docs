> **Cabbage 3** and the associated Visual Studio Code extension are currently in ***Alpha*** development. These releases are experimental and may undergo significant changes. Features are not final, and stability or performance may vary. Use at your own discretion, and expect frequent updates and potential breaking changes.

> You will need to log into GitHub in order to access the prebuild binaries mentioned belows.

Cabbage 3 uses Csound7 across all platforms. Please visit the [Csound GH Actions page](https://github.com/csound/csound/actions/workflows/csound_builds.yml). Look for a build with the `develop` tag. Click on it, and scroll to the bottom of the page where you will see packages for Windows and MacOS.   

The latest Cabbage Visual Studio Code extension can be found from the [`vscabbage` GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rorywalsh/cabbage3website/actions)page. Once you extract the `vscabbage.vsix` file you will need to manually install it in VS Code. You can manually install a VS Code extension using the Install from VSIX command in the Extensions view command dropdown, or the Extensions: Install from VSIX command in the Command Palette, point to the .vsix file.

> To take advantage of Csound language features, you should install the csound-vscode-plugin. This plugin is available in the Visual Studio Code marketplace and can be installed from the Extensions panel within Visual Studio Code.

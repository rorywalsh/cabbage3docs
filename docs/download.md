> **Cabbage 3** and the associated Visual Studio Code extension are currently in ***Alpha*** development. These releases are experimental and may undergo significant changes. Features are not final, and stability or performance may vary. Use at your own discretion, and expect frequent updates and potential breaking changes.


Please visit the [Cabbage3 GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rorywalsh/cabbage3/actions) page to download the latest Cabbage binaries. This page provides access to the newest compiled versions, including recent features, improvements, and bug fixes. Ensure you select the appropriate version for your operating system. You will need to extract the CabbageApp binary. Where you unzip it too is not important. But you will need to set its path when you set up the `vscabbage` extension. 

You will need to install the latest Cabbage Visual Studio Code extension from the [`vscabbage` GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rorywalsh/cabbage3website/actions)page. This extension is essential for integrating Cabbage with Visual Studio Code.

For detailed installation instructions on installing the Visual Studio Code extension, please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/rorywalsh/vscabbage/blob/main/readme.md). These instructions provide step-by-step guidance to help you correctly configure Cabbage and its extensions in your development environment.

To take advantage of Csound language features, you should install the csound-vscode-plugin. This plugin is available in the Visual Studio Code marketplace and can be installed from the Extensions panel within Visual Studio Code.
